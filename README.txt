Kodi Karaoke FREE
Version 1.0.2
Notes by MRFIXIT2001

The original Kodi Karaoke addon seems to be abandoned - it didn't work with Matrix (v19) and the .com expired.

But I really like this addon, so I've redeveloped it to work again. Most of the original source has
been retained, but it had a lot of problems. I've fixed as many as I could find and it's working
well for me at this point. I removed the link to all paid services as well, since the .com expired
and that was used to validate user accounts and enable things.

I have completely ignored the old paid feature that included sunflykaraoke integration. It's not
really needed for this addon to function, and that code is messy.
