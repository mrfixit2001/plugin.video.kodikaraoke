Kodi Karaoke FREE
by MRFIXIT2001

The original Kodi Karaoke addon seems to be abandoned - it didn't work with Matrix (v19) and the .com expired.

But I really like this addon, so I've redeveloped it to work again. Most of the original source has
been retained, but it had a lot of problems. I've fixed as many as I could find and it's working
well for me at this point. I removed the link to all paid services as well, since the .com expired
and that was used to validate user accounts and enable things.

I have completely ignored the old paid feature that included sunflykaraoke integration. It's not
really needed for this addon to function, and that code is messy.

I have added a built-in player so that the YouTube kodi addon is no longer a requirement. 
There is a setting in the addon that will allow you to use the youtube addon for playback if you still want to.

Due to the number of changes that youtube keeps making to it's API, and me having to keep fixing them,
I have created my own kodi repository to help with everyone keeping their addons updated.
